WoWSplit | A load-removing timer addon for World of Warcraft

---

Use ```/wowsplit``` or ```/ws``` to show or hide the addon.

Right-click the timer to show or hide the settings menu.

Add:

> /run WoWSplit:Start()
> 
> /run WoWSplit:Stop()
> 
> /run WoWSplit:Split()
> 
> /run WoWSplit:Reset()
> 
> /run WoWSplit:Skip()
> 
> /run WoWSplit:Undo()

to macros to keybind the addon's functions.

Use ```/run WoWSplit_SavedVariable = nil``` to reset the addon to default settings.

The addon is currently in alpha. Keep in mind that changing the settings has a decent change of breaking it.
